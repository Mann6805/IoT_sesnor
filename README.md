Welcome to my IoT Sensor Code Repository! Here, you'll find Arduino and ESP32 code designed for seamless sensor integration in IoT applications.

# Arduino: 
An open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's designed for creating interactive projects and prototypes, capable of reading inputs and controlling a variety of devices.

ESP32: A powerful Wi-Fi and Bluetooth-enabled microcontroller that's popular for IoT applications. It offers high processing power, low power consumption, and a variety of built-in features, making it ideal for connected projects.

IR Sensor (Infrared Sensor): Utilizes infrared radiation to detect motion or proximity. It emits and detects IR radiation to sense nearby objects, often used in security systems, automated appliances, or distance measurement devices.

Soil Sensor: Measures the moisture content in soil to determine if it's suitable for specific plants or agricultural applications. It helps in automating watering systems and maintaining optimal soil conditions.

Flame Sensor: Detects the presence of flames or fire through infrared radiation or other flame-detection mechanisms. It's commonly used in fire alarm systems or safety equipment to trigger alerts or initiate safety protocols.

Temperature Sensor: Measures ambient temperature in its surroundings. There are various types, such as thermistors, thermocouples, and digital temperature sensors, used in climate control, weather stations, or industrial applications.

Air Sensor: Measures various parameters in the air, such as humidity, air quality, gas concentrations, or particulate matter. They are crucial in environmental monitoring, indoor air quality assessment, and industrial safety.

DHT Sensor (DHT11/DHT22): A family of sensors capable of measuring temperature and humidity. They provide accurate readings and are commonly used in weather stations, HVAC systems, and home automation for climate control.
